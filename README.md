## Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Junior Front-End Developer, looking for my first commercial experience.

I have been learning programming since April 2023. While participating 11-month Full Stack Developer Kodilla bootcamp, I created many projects using JavaSript, React and NodeJS. You can see my final project [here](https://github.com/Aleksandra-Gorecka/E-commerce_Plant_Shop).
